  Returns an approximation of minimum Feedback Vertex Set (FVS) for a DiGraph G.
  An undirected graph will be converted to a directed graph.
  If the input graph is weakly connected, FVS_weakly_connected() will be called.
  If the input graph is not weakly connected, i.e. have disconnected components,
  FVS_disconnected() will be called.


  From Wikipedia:
  A Feedback Vertex Set of a graph is a set of vertices whose removal leaves a graph without cycles.
  In other words, each Feedback Vertex Set contains at least one vertex of any cycle in the graph.
  The Feedback Vertex Set problem for directed graph is an NP-complete problem in computational complexity theory.

  This algorithm is a fast approximation based on simulating annealing(SA) of a noval local search strategy [1]_.
  The function mainly called a function named FVS_local_search.
  FVS_local_search calcualte the longest sub topological ordering of G_input (directed graph)
  based on simulated annealing(SA) of local search of topological ordering.
  FVS is then G \ the topological ordering.
  The code follows the pseudocode given in Page 805 in that paper.
  This algorithm is claimed to outperform the existing heuristic algorithm,
  greedy adaptive search procedure (GRASP) by Pardalos et al.

  Parameters
  ----------
  G : NetworkX Graph/DiGraph, result for MultiGraph is not tested
  T_0 : the initial temperature  in SA
  alpha : the cooling multiplier for temperatue in the geometric cooling regime
  maxMvt_factor : maxMvt_factor times network size is the number of iterations for the inner loop given a fixed temperatue
  maxFail : FVS_local_search stops when maxFail number of outloops (temperatue) fail to improve the result
  randomseed: random seed for generating random numbers

  Returns
  -------
  An approximation of the minimum FVS of the given graph as a list.


  Examples
  --------
  #calculate a FVS for a random graph
  >>>G1 = nx.gnm_random_graph(6, 12, seed=None, directed=True)
  >>>G1_FVS = FVS.FVS(G1)
  #calculate a FVS for a toy example
  >>>G2 = nx.DiGraph()
  >>>G2.add_edges_from([('A','B'),('B','C'),('C','A'),('A','D'),('D','A')])
  >>>G2_FVS = FVS.FVS(G2)
  #result should be ['A']
