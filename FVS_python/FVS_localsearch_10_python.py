This file contains functions used to calculate feedback vertex set for directed graph

The major function is the FVS_local_search(), which calculate maximum sub topological ordering of a graph
The algorithm is given by "Applying local search to feedback vertex set problem"

The code mimic the pseudocode given in Page 805 in that paper

def FVS_local_search(G_input, T_0, alpha, maxMvt, maxFail, randomseed=None):
  '''
  Returns an maximum sub topological ordering of a DiGraph G.
  FVS is G_input \ the topological ordering
  A topological ordering of a graph is an ordering of vertices such that
  the starting point of every arc occurs earlier in the ordering than
  the endpoint of the art.

  This algorithm is a fast approximation based on simulating annealing(SA) of a noval local search strategy [1]_.
  The code follows the pseudocode given in Page 805 in that paper.


  Parameters
  ----------
  G : NetworkX Graph/DiGraph, result for MultiGraph is not tested
  T_0 : the initial temperature  in SA
  alpha : the cooling multiplier for temperatue in the geometric cooling regime
  maxMvt_factor : maxMvt_factor times network size is the number of iterations for the inner loop given a fixed temperatue
  maxFail : FVS_local_search stops when maxFail number of outloops (temperatue) fail to improve the result
  randomseed: random seed for generating random numbers

  Returns
  -------
  An approximation of the maximum ordering of the given graph as a list.


  Notes
  -----
  The code is written by Gang Yang, Department of Physics, Penn State University
